# Data Science Ecosystem and Tools
```


```python
In this notebook, we will explore some of the most commonly used tools, languages,
and libraries in the field of Data Science.We will also perform some simple 
arithmetic operations to demonstrate basic programming capabilities.
```


```python
## Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
1. R  
2. Python  
3. SQL  
4. Java  
5. Julia  
```


```python
## Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow  
- ggplot2  
```


```python

```python
## Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
```


```python
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add numbers
(3 * 4) + 5
```


```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours
```


```python
## Objectives:
- List popular languages for Data Science
- List commonly used libraries
- Create and format tables using Markdown
- Perform arithmetic operations using Python
